# Define variables
principal = 1000      # initial investment
rate = 0.05           # annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3              # number of years

# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
